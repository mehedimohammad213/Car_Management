- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
